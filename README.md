# Hi there, I'm Stamatis! 👋

I am a **Computational Physicist** and **Research Software Engineer** finishing my PhD at **Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute)** and **IMAPP@Radboud University Nijmegen**. I specialize in bridging high-level theoretical physics with high-performance numerical implementation.

## 🚀 Professional Highlights
* **HPC Scalability:** Designed and implemented a Python-based automation pipeline that processed over **100,000 simulations** on HPC systems.
* **Numerical Optimization:** Developed novel **Summation By Parts (SBP)** finite difference operators for spherical symmetry.
* **Algorithm Development:** Built a new numerical framework for self-force calculations using **3D Finite Volume and Finite Difference** methods in Julia.
* **Data Science:** Improved parameter estimation for gravitational wave models by an **order of magnitude** using physics-informed priors and machine learning.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Julia, Python, Mathematica, C/C++, Fortran,
* **Numerical Methods:** Finite Volume (FVM), Finite Difference (FDM), Bayesian Inference, Monte Carlo
* **HPC & DevOps:** Slurm, LIKWID, Git (CI/CD), Bash/Linux, OpenMP

## 🔬 Current Research Focus
* **Waveform Modeling:** Developing E/IMRI waveforms using Numerical Relativity.
* **Advanced Numerics:** Implementing **Discontinuous Galerkin Methods** and developing SBP operators for spherical symmetry.
* **Self-Force:** Formulating self-force as an initial value problem for upcoming publications in **Physical Review D**.
