# Hi there, I'm Stamatis! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a PhD candidate at Radboud University working on EMRI waveforms using Numerical Relativity. EMRIs are one of the most promising sources to be detected by the LISA mission, enabling us to have a cartography of spacetime around a supermassive black hole. Modelling them is hard and requires to take self-force into account.  

## About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Waveform modelling of E/IMRIs**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Finite Volume Methods and Dinscontinuous Galerking Methods**
- 📫 How to reach me: **svretina@physics.auth.gr**

## My Skills

- **Languages**: Julia, Mathematica, Python, C, MATALB, Bash
- **Tools**: emacs, HPC, slurm, git, linux, CI/CT
