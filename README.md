# Hi there, I'm Stamatis! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a Computational Physicist finishing my PhD at IMAPP (Radboud University) and at the Albert Einstein Institute.
I work on E/IMRI waveforms using Numerical Relativity. In my research I am using Finite Volume and Finite Difference 
simulations on HPC facilities.

## About Me
I’m currently 
- working on **Waveform modelling of E/IMRIs** using the Finite Volume Method
- developing Summation By Parts Operators (SBP) for spherical symmetry
- learning **Dinscontinuous Galerking Methods**
